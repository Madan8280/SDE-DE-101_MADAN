The key responsibility of a data engineer is building and continuos monitoring of the pipelines.

 FIRST STEP FOR DATA ENGINEERS 
  1. Understanding the bussiness goals, what company requirements are ?
        When building pipelines keep in mind to start with a bussiness problem to be solved.

DATA WRANGLING :
     is process of manipulating the raw data through cleaning ,structuring and tansform to meaningful data 
          to work with.

DATA WRANGLING INVOLVES SIX STEPS:
     1. data discovery
     2. data structuring
     3. data cleaning
     4. data enrichment
     5. data validating
     6. daat publishing



Assignment : enabling data to data anlytics

     through this assignment we expolre how data engineer works in end-to-end steps 
     1.understand what business may need,  based on the requirements of the organization then we know what 
        type of data we need to collect.
     2.After gathering the data ,you can go to further steps but here the data is in different format using tools and scripts to change the data
        into a single source of truth ( use tool like pandas)
     3.store the data in data lake after performing ETL or ELT operations (use amazon redshift)
     4.secure the data who can use it and how much they will see (use amazon iam)
     5. continous monitoring the pipeline (use amazon cloud watch)
